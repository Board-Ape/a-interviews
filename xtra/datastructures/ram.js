Random Access Memory
    - As a computer runs code it tracks (numbers, strings, arrays etc.)
    - Variables of this nature are stored here.

    Processor:
    - Does all the work inside you computer
        Cache:
        - Stores a copy of recently read frm RAM

    Memory Controller:
    - Does the actual reading and writing to and from RAM.
    - Direct connection to each shelf.
        - That's critical since we can access at 0(1).
        - There are performance increases when memory is nearby
            - When contents are retrieved for a particular address, a handful or nearby memory addresses are also sent

    RAM Stack
    - Analogy of a Tall Bookcase
    - Shelves are numbered
    - The number os the address
    - Each shelf holds 8 bits made up of 1's and 0'sf
