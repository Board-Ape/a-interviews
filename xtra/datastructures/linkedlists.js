Linked Lists

- Discussed before in the Dynamic Arrays. These have a time cost of slower appends. Creating a word processor we want fast appends.

- Create nodes that hold the data of each letter and then has pointer that points to the next node or letter of the word.

- NOT Cache friendly though

- Have fast prepends and appends BUT slow look-ups.
